When we talk about two-factor authentication we often think about two things:

- Something the user knows (e.g. username/password)
- Something the user has.

For the latter, in Spain, banks often issue a https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarjeta_de_coordenadas[Coordinate Card]

Users need to enter username, password and a coordinate to login into their bank.

We are going to customize https://grails-plugins.github.io/grails-spring-security-core/v3/index.html[Spring Security Core Plugin]
to achieve such a login in a Grails 3 application.


First, We need to add Spring Security Core Plugin as a dependency:

[source,groovy]
./build.gradle

include::{sourceDir}/build.gradle[indent=0,tag=dependencySSC]
