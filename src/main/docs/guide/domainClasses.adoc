Use `s2-quickstart` to generate the default Spring Security Core domain classes:

[source,bash]
----
grails s2-quickstart demo User Role
----

`s2-quickstart` script generates three domain classes; `User`, `Role` and `UserRole`. Service injection in GORM entities is disabled by default since Grails 3.2.8. Because of that, if you want the service `springSecurityService` to get injected
in the `User` domain class you would need to turn on `autowire`.  Another option would be to move the password encoding logic outside of the domain class.

[source,groovy]
.grails-app/conf/application.yml

include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/conf/application.yml[indent=0, lines="46,53,54,55,56"]

Each user is going to have a coordinate card. Thus we have modified the User domain class slightly:


[source,groovy]
./grails-app/domain/demo/User.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/domain/demo/User.groovy[indent=0]
----

[source,groovy]
./grails-app/domain/demo/SecurityCoordinate.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/domain/demo/SecurityCoordinate.groovy[indent=0]
