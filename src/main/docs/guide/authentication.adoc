In order to create a custom authentication, we often need a custom `Authentication`.

`org.springframework.security.core.Authentication`

Authentication represents the token for an authentication request or an authenticated principal
once the request has been processed by the method:

`AuthenticationManager.authenticate(Authentication)`

This generally means:

- Either extend an existing implementation.

`org.springframework.security.authentication.UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken`

- Or directly implement the interface `Authentication`

What we are trying to achieve is an extension of the common username/password functionality offered
already by the plugin. We don't need a custom authentication object. Instead, we are going to use
the `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken` object and place in the `details` property our custom information; the coordinate.
